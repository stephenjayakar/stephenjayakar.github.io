&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Find a hard problem. Something like creating a browser, adding raytracing to an old game, adding VR to an old game, decompiling an old game (are you starting to see a trend?)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get an agent structure that allows you to run an agent on an always-on machine. It should be the same platform as the machine that will run the &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; - if it&amp;rsquo;s a game, probably Windows. I&amp;rsquo;m using Opencode + Kimaki to check in on Discord&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ralph loops. I created a skill &lt;a

 class="link--external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
 
>here&lt;/a>. For the initial codebase, have it create a comprehensive PLAN.md, and then setup a Ralph Loop until the PLAN.md is complete. You can have it keep kicking off agents until there are no &lt;code>- [ ]&lt;/code> left in the document.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(But not necessarily last): make it so that the agent can somehow verify its output. A screenshot harness, the ability to directly set state to a certain position, are super super important as as your topic gets more niche, AI is less likely to output code that works on the first try.&lt;/li>

 href="https://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introducingthe-scrub"
 
 
 class="link--external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
 
>Original Article&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve felt this tension between &amp;ldquo;scrubs&amp;rdquo; and people trying to have fun, especially when playing competitive Smash. I do agree that it&amp;rsquo;s frustrating when people purport to be competitive but are actually scrubs. There are some points I think are missing though:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Games can change over time, especially when you complain a ton. Within the last two decades in Melee, wobbling was discovered (2006) and then finally banned (2019). The technique was degenerate, and hated in almost all levels of play. If people just sucked it up and dealt with it, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it would have been banned. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, &lt;a
 href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Wobbling?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
 
 
 class="link--external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
 
>wobbling&lt;/a> results in you being unable to move and pummeled until you die for up to minutes at a time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being competitive is great; but it&amp;rsquo;s not like being competitive and &amp;ldquo;having fun&amp;rdquo; are more or less honorable than each other. When you engage in an activity with someone else, the goal isn&amp;rsquo;t always to &amp;ldquo;completely crush them.&amp;rdquo; Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s just to have fun, right? In the case where some techniques aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo;, it seems fine to limit yourself from using them.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If anything it&amp;rsquo;s a bit socially awkward if you can&amp;rsquo;t sense the mismatch in competitive drive and don&amp;rsquo;t tailor to what your gaming partner is expecting.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Hollow Knight: much better with a guide!</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/hollow-knight/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 13:07:30 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/hollow-knight/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Score: 8/10&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hollow Knight: Silksong came out recently, and I got so much fomo as I had never completed the previous entry. I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to clear the game 2 times, and just started my third playthrough. As of finishing this entry, I beat the final boss and ended up getting the 2nd best ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hollow Knight &lt;strong>is hard&lt;/strong>. If you only have a cursory interest in video games, I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend the game. As someone who is mildly masochistic and isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly good enough for Elden Ring, Hollow Knight is at the perfect threshold in difficulty for me where I can clear bosses after around 10 tries and a crashout in my journal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>`opencode` or Claude Code?</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/opencode-claude/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 15:32:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/opencode-claude/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Just so that people don&amp;rsquo;t get confused, &lt;a

I notice this especially when people struggle to read anything older than X year (e.g. 1960), because it has concepts that they fundamentally disagree with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I call it “empathy for the author.” When reading a text and trying to understand it, my first goal is to try to learn as much about the author as possible and their worldview. Then, I attempt to understand the points they’re making. I think other people should do the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ChatGPT isn't a decompiler... yet</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/chatgpt-not-compiler/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 00:00:06 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/chatgpt-not-compiler/</guid><description>&lt;p>Previous article: &lt;a

&lt;p>When consuming other people&amp;rsquo;s blog posts, the first thing that stood out to me was aesthetics. You get an impression about the platform and the person simply by the details of how their text looks. Does their code have great, language-specific highlights? Do they use &lt;code>monospace&lt;/code> + does their platform support it? How is the image formatting? What about the base color scheme?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why pay for Notion’s AI?

When using a capo, the actual underlying chord is &amp;lsquo;A + 7 half steps&amp;rsquo;. This means if you&amp;rsquo;re collaborating with another instrument or with someone not using a capo, you need to communicate the actual chord you&amp;rsquo;re playing. This requires some mental math, which I found slightly embarrassing as I didn&amp;rsquo;t always immediately know what chord I was playing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The first use of YHWH in the Bible is pretty odd</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/the-first-use-of-yhwh-in-the-bible/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 21:18:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/the-first-use-of-yhwh-in-the-bible/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally posted &lt;a

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gen 1:1 NET&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The word for God here is &lt;code>Elohim&lt;/code>. There are some interesting tidbits about this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The noun is in its plural form. Singular would be &lt;code>Eloah&lt;/code>. While this seems really controversial, in most of the usages, it’s paired with a singular verb. AKA “created” up there is masculine singular.

&lt;p>Please. It’s an insult to my brain. Like, you put the button in one place, and then you’re like “nah, let’s move it somewhere else.” Here are some examples that have annoyed me the most lately:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lyft-bike-scan-button">Lyft Bike Scan Button&lt;a href="#lyft-bike-scan-button" class="post-heading__anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>This one sucks as I’m often opening the Lyft app just to ride bikes. So I immediately hit the bike button and I’m trying to hit the “Scan” button as quickly as possible. But no! Depending on how fast my internet is at the current moment, that banner will appear and push the Scan button up, which means I end up hitting the banner instead 😟; this is often a really frustrating start to my daily commute.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Big Rocks</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/big-rocks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 13:56:54 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/big-rocks/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally posted &lt;a

&lt;p>but then, i put the straus whole fat milk first. and then the yogurt. and then i put the cheese, and the cute lil snax. i fit everything! the bag was kinda heavy though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Attachment Styles at Work</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/attachment-styles-at-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 13:50:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/attachment-styles-at-work/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally posted &lt;a

&lt;p>my friends are all attachment styles this and attachment styles that when it comes to dating. however, has anyone had the brilliant idea of applying attachment styles to working at a tech company? I didn’t think so! now you might be thinking, “hey Stephen isn’t this a bad idea?” and yes, it is. but just like we should all hope to be secure partners in our relationships, we should also &lt;em>possibly&lt;/em> strive to be secure capitalistic partners at work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adopting the OpenAPI schema to generate Plaid's SDKs</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/plaid-adopting-openapi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 13:03:41 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/plaid-adopting-openapi/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally posted on the &lt;a

&lt;p>The developer experience team focuses on building tools and features that make it as easy as possible for developers to explore our APIs and integrate with Plaid. This year, our team adopted an OpenAPI schema (OAS) as a specification for our API. We launched this schema in beta earlier this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our team is responsible for maintaining three sources of truth for our API that allow developers to build and test their integrations:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Writing ES6 Everywhere</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/writing-es6-everywhere/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2019 12:55:44 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/writing-es6-everywhere/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally posted on the &lt;a

&lt;p>This article is going to be a quick intro to the basics of writing modern JavaScript all the time, rather than being dependent on what environment is supported by a given browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro&lt;a href="#intro" class="post-heading__anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, what is ES6?  &lt;strong>E&lt;/strong>CMA&lt;strong>S&lt;/strong>cript 6 is the sixth standardized version of JavaScript, which is ultimately a specification of language features.  ES6 added a ton of really great features that drastically improved the ability to construct larger-scale programs with JavaScript (like constants and block scoping!).  It’s important to note, as ES6 is only a specification, it’s ultimately up to the browsers to provide an implementation for these new features: often, certain browsers lag behind on implementing all these features (i.e. IE).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Quick Dive Into Python's Slots</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/a-quick-dive-into-pythons-slots/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2018 18:00:10 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/a-quick-dive-into-pythons-slots/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally posted &lt;a

&lt;p>For my first Medium article, we’re going to go into a quick and easy way to speed up your Python code (and pass those pesky HackerRank tests where you’re just a bit short on time!), as well as some of the technical implementation details for the curious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>__slots__&lt;/code> is an attribute you can add to a Python class when defining it. You define slots with the possible attributes that an instance of an object can possess. Here’s how you use &lt;code>__slots__&lt;/code>:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
