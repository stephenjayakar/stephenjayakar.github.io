      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading the Bible in an academic fashion has taught me a skill that has been extremely useful when reading other historical texts, but seems to be something that modern readers seem to be losing. I notice this especially when people struggle to read anything older than X year (e.g. 1960), because it has concepts that they fundamentally disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I call it ‚Äúempathy for the author.‚Äù When reading a text and trying to understand it, my first goal is to try to learn as much about the author as possible and their worldview. Then, I attempt to understand the points they‚Äôre making. I think other people should do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
