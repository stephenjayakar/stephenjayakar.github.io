I notice this especially when people struggle to read anything older than X year (e.g. 1960), because it has concepts that they fundamentally disagree with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I call it “empathy for the author.” When reading a text and trying to understand it, my first goal is to try to learn as much about the author as possible and their worldview. Then, I attempt to understand the points they’re making. I think other people should do the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The first use of YHWH in the Bible is pretty odd</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/the-first-use-of-yhwh-in-the-bible/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 21:18:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/the-first-use-of-yhwh-in-the-bible/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally posted &lt;a

&lt;p>You know the first verse of the Bible, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gen 1:1 NET&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The word for God here is &lt;code>Elohim&lt;/code>. There are some interesting tidbits about this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The noun is in its plural form. Singular would be &lt;code>Eloah&lt;/code>. While this seems really controversial, in most of the usages, it’s paired with a singular verb. AKA “created” up there is masculine singular. So it’s often interpreted as a majestic plural.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yom: Examining Creations Timeframe With Linguistics</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/yom-examining-creations-timeframe-with-linguistics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 21:07:37 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/yom-examining-creations-timeframe-with-linguistics/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally posted &lt;a

&lt;p>I’ve often encountered Christians that believe the world was created in 7 24-hour days, because “that’s what the Bible says” in Genesis 1 and they won’t believe otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a ton of arguments against this “fact,” but I think the most compelling one is &lt;strong>the linguistic ambiguity for the word “day” (&lt;/strong>&lt;code>yom&lt;/code>&lt;strong>) used in the creation account&lt;/strong>. First, let’s take a look at an English translation for one of the days of creation:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
