&lt;p>It feels a bit pretentious to open a blog post with an abstract. However, I wanted to communicate up front concisely &lt;em>what&lt;/em> I tried to do, and what the open areas of exploration are. Those who are interested can dig more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I wanted to make ChatGPT into a magic decompiler for PowerPC assembly to supercharge the Super Smash Bros. Melee (&amp;ldquo;Melee&amp;rdquo;) decompilation project.&lt;/strong> I observed over a year ago that ChatGPT was surprisingly good at understanding PowerPC assembly language and generating C code that was logically equivalent. I also saw other papers that were attempting to use LLMs as decompilers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What I'm up to</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/what-i-have-been-up-to/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 17:05:52 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/what-i-have-been-up-to/</guid><description>&lt;p>A lot of people have been asking what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to since I left Plaid at the beginning of this month.

When writing more and more technical stuff, I realized that some stacks were definitely better than others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When consuming other people&amp;rsquo;s blog posts, the first thing that stood out to me was aesthetics. You get an impression about the platform and the person simply by the details of how their text looks. Does their code have great, language-specific highlights? Do they use &lt;code>monospace&lt;/code> + does their platform support it? How is the image formatting? What about the base color scheme?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why pay for Notion’s AI?

&lt;p>During the holidays, I wanted to get better at answering questions like “what is 7 half steps up from A?&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>” I often found myself in the situation of having these problems as a lot of guitar chord sheets are written something like “A capo 7” which means you put the big barre thing on your guitar and play an A-shape chord. When using a capo, the actual underlying chord is &amp;lsquo;A + 7 half steps&amp;rsquo;. This means if you&amp;rsquo;re collaborating with another instrument or with someone not using a capo, you need to communicate the actual chord you&amp;rsquo;re playing. This requires some mental math, which I found slightly embarrassing as I didn&amp;rsquo;t always immediately know what chord I was playing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Notes on Google's TrueTime</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/spanner/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2023 14:41:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/spanner/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally posted &lt;a

&lt;p>This one sucks as I’m often opening the Lyft app just to ride bikes. So I immediately hit the bike button and I’m trying to hit the “Scan” button as quickly as possible. But no! Depending on how fast my internet is at the current moment, that banner will appear and push the Scan button up, which means I end up hitting the banner instead 😟; this is often a really frustrating start to my daily commute.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Attachment Styles at Work</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/attachment-styles-at-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 13:50:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/attachment-styles-at-work/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally posted &lt;a

&lt;p>First, what is ES6?  &lt;strong>E&lt;/strong>CMA&lt;strong>S&lt;/strong>cript 6 is the sixth standardized version of JavaScript, which is ultimately a specification of language features.  ES6 added a ton of really great features that drastically improved the ability to construct larger-scale programs with JavaScript (like constants and block scoping!).  It’s important to note, as ES6 is only a specification, it’s ultimately up to the browsers to provide an implementation for these new features: often, certain browsers lag behind on implementing all these features (i.e. IE).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Quick Dive Into Python's Slots</title><link>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/a-quick-dive-into-pythons-slots/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2018 18:00:10 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://stephenjayakar.github.io/posts/a-quick-dive-into-pythons-slots/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally posted &lt;a
