&lt;p>Hollow Knight: Silksong came out recently, and I got so much fomo as I had never completed the previous entry. I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to clear the game 2 times, and just started my third playthrough. As of finishing this entry, I beat the final boss and ended up getting the 2nd best ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hollow Knight &lt;strong>is hard&lt;/strong>. If you only have a cursory interest in video games, I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend the game. As someone who is mildly masochistic and isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly good enough for Elden Ring, Hollow Knight is at the perfect threshold in difficulty for me where I can clear bosses after around 10 tries and a crashout in my journal.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
