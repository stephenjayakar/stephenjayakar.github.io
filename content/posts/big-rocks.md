iâ€™ve been thinking about the big rocks every day

for those who donâ€™t know: https://lnkd.in/gZGfgBE9

just the other day, i was at whole foods. and i tried to fit the items into my cute tote bag haphazardly. they didnâ€™t fit!!

but then, i put the straus whole fat milk first. and then the yogurt. and then i put the cheese, and the cute lil snax. i fit everything! the bag was kinda heavy though.

think about your big rocksðŸª¨ðŸª¨ðŸª¨ðŸª¨
